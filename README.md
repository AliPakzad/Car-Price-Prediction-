# Car-Price-Prediction-

Download the used car dataset by visiting the link (https://www.kaggle.com/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction). In this data, the goal is to predict the price column according to the characteristics of the cars such as mileage, automatic or manual, engine fuel, etc. which are data columns.

- Analyze the data using appropriate visualizations. (Example: Engine fuel type histogram)

- Use 15% of the data for test and the rest for training and validation.

- Design and optimize a suitable neural network for this prediction and display the loss, rmse and mae metrics for 100 epochs.

- Design a network with one layer and neurons between 50 and 500 to solve this problem. Solve the problem for 5 different numbers of neurons and plot the minimum mae obtained for each number of neurons in a graph. Analyze the effect of increasing the number of neurons.

- Build a network with 100 neurons per layer and the number of layers 1, 2, 5 and 7. As in the previous step, plot the minimum mae obtained for each number of layers. Analyze the effect of increasing the number of layers.

- Implement a suitable wide and deep network to solve this problem and compare the results with the optimized deep network.
